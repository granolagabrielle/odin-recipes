    <h2>Recipe Description</h2>
        <p>
            This soup is the best fall comfort food! It's rich, cheesy and hard to believe it's vegan.
        </p>
<h3>Ingredients</h3> 
    <ul>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>1 small sweet onion, chopped</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 medium russet potato, peeled and chopped</li>
        <li>3 medium carrots, peeled and chopped</li>
        <li>1/2 cup raw cashews</li>
        <li>4 cups vegetable broth</li>
        <li>1/2 cup nutritional yeast</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon smoked paprika</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt, or to taste</li>
        <li>1-2 cups water, as needed (see instructions)</li>
        <li>4 cups broccoli, finely chopped</li>
        <li>2 cups shredded vegan cheddar cheese</li>
    </ul>   
<h4>Steps</h4>    
    <ol>
        <li>In a large soup pot, saute the onion and garlic in the olive oil for 2-3 minutes over medium heat, stirring frequently.</li>
        <li>To the pot, add the potato, carrots, cashews, vegetable broth, nutritional yeast, smoked paprika and salt. Bring to a boil, then lower the heat and simmer for about 15 minutes, until fork tender.</li>
        <li>Working in batches if needed, transfer the soup carefully to a blender and blend until very smooth.</li>
        <li>Return the mixture back to the pot. If your soup is too thick, add water until a desired consistency is reached (I used 1 cup of water). Add in the bite sized broccoli florets and cheese, if using, and stir into the soup. </li>
        <li>Bring the soup to a boil, then lower the heat to simmer for 10 minutes, until the broccoli is soft and cooked. The cheese should also be melted into the soup.</li>
        <li>Serve, topping with more vegan cheddar cheese shreds, if desired. Enjoy! Leftovers will keep for 3-4 days in an airtight container in the refrigerator. It can also be frozen.</li>
    </ol>
